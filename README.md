# Novel-Covid-19-dataset-
Mined interesting patterns of the virus distribution among different populations, extracted different association rules and trained a model that predicts the outcome of positive tested Covid-19 patients. The main stages of Data Mining were applied to do an end-to-end study of the raw data. (Python, pandas, sklearn, mlxtend, association rules)

## 💻⚒️
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Nltk, Re, Sklearn, Plt, Mlxtend)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

## 📘📖
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
  - Standardize Variables (clustirizing --DBSCAN-- categories)
  - Dealing with missing values with imputation
  - Hanlding Outliers
  - Addition of new variables
- Predicting --Patient Outcome-- (KNN, Decition Tree, MLP)
- Association Rule Mining (FP-Growth)
